Experience
----------
**BBVA Compass:**

#### Technical Architect II

I am working principally in automation in deployment and testing, and programing best practices. 
We have been working to move our infrastructure to AWS and have been using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)
to set up our infrastructure as code. I'd consider myself a Linux Administrator, who also enjoys
coding and scripting. I've also been the principal Administrator for [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server)
, [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo), [Nexus](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo), 
[Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), which we are using as part
of our continuous delivery pipeline. I've also been the principal contact for technical questions regarding Git and Maven. 
I am certified in all of the AWS associate level certifications.
I was RHCSA certified for Red Hat Linux, but it's now lapsed.  I am proficient in Bash scripting and Python.
